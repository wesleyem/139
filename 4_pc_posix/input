The synchronization mechanism of mutex-lock and condition-variables plays 
a pivotal role in monitors. This programming assignment gives you an 
opportunity to use the mechanism in the bounded-buffer producer-consumer 
implementation of a file copying operation. Unlike in Program 3 where we 
need to make sure that the order of two semaphore wait operations is 
correct, here when a thread has to block, the pthread_cond_wait will 
automatically release the mutex lock, hence avoiding potential deadlock. 
Many of the other functionalities in your program 3 can still be reused. 
This exercise will shed light on the difference between the semaphore based 
approach and the mutex-lock/condition-variable based approach.
