The bounded-buffer producer/consumer approach can be applied to 
a variety of different scenarios. In this programming assignment, 
you will use the bounded-buffer producer/consumer approach to 
implement a file copying operation. Both a producer thread and 
a consumer thread work with a buffer of 10 slots. The producer 
reads a string of 12-byte at a time from the input file (i.e., 
this file), and writes it to the next available slot in the 
buffer. The consumer, on the other hand, reads a 12-byte string 
from the next filled buffer slot, and writes it to the output 
file such that the output file becomes a verbatim copy of the 
input file. Note that the last string may not be exactly 12-byte 
long. Semaphores are used to enforce the mutually exclusive 
access to the buffer and the synchronization conditions between 
the producer and the consumer.
